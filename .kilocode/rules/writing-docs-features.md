# Documenting Features

When documenting features at `docs/features`, focus on explaining the model on a descriptive level. Provide relevant theoretical remarks as summarized in `docs/_source`. Use jargon sparingly as long as it's consistent with the `.env` and `.env.example`.

# Guidelines

- Use plain English, no emojis
- Always explain associated functions with formal mathematical equation
- Always cite the code path + line number of the explained functions
- Make it understandable for the general audience
- Use standardize lexicon consistently as what is outlined in `.env` or `.env.example`
- DO NOT substitute the term for defined environment variables
- DO NOT include code snippet
