Use `.kilocode/rules/math/notation.md` as a reference when writing mathematical equations.

## Guidelines

- Use a consistent and brief notation.
- Use greek letter, `\mathcal`, `\mathfrak`, and `\mathbb` consistently.
- Choose the right mathematical typeset to ensure that all notation all succinct and clearly defined.
- The mathematical notation must uniquely describe a concept.
- Avoid inconsistently using the same mathematical notation for highly distinct concept.
- Similarly defined concept may use the same mathematical notation, but add subscript to improve clarity.
- Use well-known symbols for each concept if such symbols exist; else, select the most appropriate one.
- If a concept is not defined, then update `.kilocode/rules/math/notation.md`.
