# Product: Agent-Based Model for Mental Health Promotion Cost-Effectiveness

## Purpose

This research project develops an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to evaluate and compare the cost-effectiveness of three mental health promotion program approaches:
- **Universal programmes** - targeting general audiences 
- **Selective programmes** - targeting higher-risk groups
- **Indicated programmes** - targeting patients with specific conditions

## Problem Statement

Mental health public intervention programmes have been extensively studied, but health-economics evaluation remains controversial due to:
- Quality and methodological differences between programmes
- Limited generalizability across different contexts
- Insufficient comparative analysis of intervention approaches

## Research Question

**Primary:** How cost-effective are workplace-based universal mental health promotion programmes at the community level?

## Solution Approach

The ABM simulates agents (individuals) experiencing:
- **Stress events** with controllability, predictability, and overload attributes
- **Challenge vs. hindrance** appraisal mechanisms
- **Resource dynamics** including social support, family support, formal interventions, and psychological capital
- **Network effects** through social connections and mutual aid
- **Adaptation mechanisms** for learning and resilience building

## Target Outcomes

1. **Protocol Document** - detailing model conceptualization, parameterization, and validation
2. **Scientific Manuscript** - providing comparative analysis of three approaches with cost-benefit details for achieving target resilience levels

## Success Criteria

- Robust comparison of cost-effectiveness across universal, selective, and indicated mental health promotion approaches
- Model validation against empirical pattern targets from literature
- Demonstration of improved resilience and reduced prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorder
- Actionable insights for workplace mental health program design

## User Experience Goals

**For Researchers:**
- Clear, reproducible model implementation
- Well-documented parameter spaces and sensitivity analyses
- Validated results supporting publication-quality research

**For Policymakers:**
- Evidence-based recommendations for program selection
- Cost-effectiveness data to support funding decisions
- Scenario analysis for different implementation contexts
