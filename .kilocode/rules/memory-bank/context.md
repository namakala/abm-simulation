3. **R Analysis Pipeline** - Configure R environment for statistical analysis and visualization
4. **Validation Framework** - Implement pattern matching against literature targets using configuration system
5. **Parameter Calibration** - Use configuration system for systematic parameter sweeps and sensitivity analysis

## Current State

- **Core ABM:** Fully functional Python implementation using Mesa framework with all theoretical components
- **Configuration System:** Complete `.env`-based parameter management with 50+ configurable parameters, type conversion, validation, and comprehensive documentation
- **Agent Model:** Complete Person class with all specified state variables and behaviors
- **Network Structure:** Watts-Strogatz social network with configurable parameters via environment variables
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, configuration validation, and CI/CD pipeline
- **Debug Tools:** Threshold evaluation and stress processing debugging utilities for troubleshooting
- **Coverage Reporting:** Automated test coverage tracking with 80% minimum threshold and HTML report generation
- **Dependencies:** Mesa, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, python-dotenv, pytest implemented; R environment configured but not yet integrated
- **Data Storage:** Directory structure ready; SQL integration pending
- **Documentation:** Complete configuration system documentation; protocol development ready to begin
- **Shell Utilities:** Configuration extraction and management scripts for research workflows

## Key Decisions Made

- **Primary implementation language:** Python with Mesa framework (chosen for ABM capabilities and ease of use)
- **Network framework:** NetworkX for graph operations and network analysis
- **Architecture pattern:** Modular utility-based design for maximum testability and maintainability
- **Testing approach:** Unit tests for all utility functions before integration

## Key Decisions Resolved

- **Framework choice:** Mesa ABM framework selected over custom implementation
- **Network topology:** Watts-Strogatz small-world networks for realistic social connections
- **Code organization:** Utility-first modular design with comprehensive testing
