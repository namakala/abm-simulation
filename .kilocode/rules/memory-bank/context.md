- **Advanced Configuration System** - Complete `.env`-based parameter system with 50+ configurable parameters, organized into logical categories (simulation, agent behavior, stress events, appraisal, social interactions, affect dynamics, resilience dynamics, resource dynamics, mathematical utilities, output/logging)
- **Configuration Documentation** - Comprehensive CONFIGURATION.md with detailed parameter descriptions, usage scenarios, best practices, troubleshooting guides, and integration examples
- **Shell Utilities** - Configuration management scripts (`extract_env.sh`, `update_env_example.sh`) for automated parameter extraction and environment file synchronization
- **CI/CD Infrastructure** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, coverage reporting, and continuous integration with 80% minimum coverage threshold
- **Coverage Reporting** - Codecov integration with HTML report generation for comprehensive test coverage analysis
- **Debug Tools** - Specialized debugging utilities for threshold evaluation (`debug_threshold.py`) and stress processing troubleshooting (`simple_threshold_test.py`)
- **Enhanced Documentation** - Detailed configuration guide with 4 usage scenarios, programmatic examples, parameter sweep workflows, and research pipeline integration
- **Environment Management** - Multiple configuration files for different deployment scenarios (development, production, research scenarios) with environment-specific optimization

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Database Integration** - Set up SQL schema for storing simulation results and parameter sweeps
2. **R Analysis Pipeline** - Complete R environment integration for statistical analysis and visualization
3. **Validation Framework** - Implement pattern matching against literature targets using configuration system
4. **Parameter Calibration** - Use configuration system for systematic parameter sweeps and sensitivity analysis
5. **Protocol Development** - Begin writing research protocol document using established configuration system

## Current State

- **Core ABM:** Fully functional Python implementation using Mesa framework with all theoretical components (stress events, challenge/hindrance appraisal, resource dynamics, social interactions, affect dynamics, resilience mechanisms)
- **Configuration System:** Production-ready `.env`-based parameter management with 50+ configurable parameters, type conversion, validation, and comprehensive documentation
- **Agent Model:** Complete Person class with all specified state variables (resources, distress, stress threshold, network position, protective factors) and behaviors
- **Network Structure:** Watts-Strogatz small-world network with configurable parameters via environment variables (mean degree, rewiring probability)
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite with 18 specialized test files, 80%+ coverage requirement, CI/CD pipeline integration, and automated reporting
- **Debug Tools:** Threshold evaluation and stress processing debugging utilities for development and troubleshooting
- **Coverage Reporting:** Automated test coverage tracking with Codecov integration and HTML report generation
- **Dependencies:** Mesa, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, python-dotenv, pytest fully implemented; R environment (renv) configured and ready for integration
- **Data Storage:** Directory structure established (data/raw, data/processed); SQL integration pending
- **Documentation:** Complete configuration system documentation with usage scenarios and research workflow integration; protocol development preparation complete
