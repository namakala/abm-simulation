# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

**Project Phase:** Initial setup and foundation building
- Agent-based model framework design and architecture planning
- Parameter specification and literature-based calibration preparation
- Development environment configuration

## Recent Changes

- **Memory bank initialization** (current session)
- **Project structure established** with organized directories for multi-language implementation
- **R environment configured** using renv for reproducible package management
- **Directory structure prepared** for data (raw/processed), docs (source/results), and source code (R/Python/SQL)

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Model Architecture Design** - Define agent classes, state variables, and interaction mechanisms
2. **Parameter Framework** - Implement parameter sampling and calibration system
3. **Core ABM Implementation** - Start with basic agent lifecycle and stress event processing
4. **Validation Framework** - Design pattern-matching validation against literature targets

## Current State

- **Source code directories:** Empty - awaiting initial implementation
- **Data directories:** Empty - structured for raw and processed data
- **Documentation:** Basic bibliography structure in place, ready for protocol development
- **Dependencies:** R environment configured with renv, Python and SQL support planned
- **Technical foundation:** Ready for development to begin

## Key Decisions Pending

- Primary implementation language choice (R vs Python for core ABM)
- Database integration approach for large-scale parameter sweeps
- Visualization and analysis pipeline architecture
- Testing and validation methodology
