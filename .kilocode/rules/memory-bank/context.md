# Current Context

## Current Work Focus

**Project Phase:** Advanced implementation and validation
- Comprehensive configuration management system implemented and documented
- Extensive testing framework established across all modules
- Parameter management and environment variable system operational
- Research-ready simulation framework with full customization capabilities

## Recent Changes

- **CI/CD Infrastructure** - GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing, coverage reporting, and continuous integration
- **Debug Tools** - Added debugging utilities for threshold evaluation and stress processing troubleshooting
- **Enhanced Testing Suite** - Added configuration integration tests, dataclass validation, environment variable validation, and dependency testing
- **Coverage Reporting** - Comprehensive test coverage tracking with Codecov integration and HTML report generation
- **Configuration Management** - Complete `.env`-based parameter system with type conversion, validation, and comprehensive documentation
- **Environment Management** - Both `.env.example` template and `.env` configuration files for different deployment scenarios
- **Core ABM Implementation** - Fully functional with all theoretical components implemented and thoroughly tested
- **Modular Architecture** - Well-tested utility modules with comprehensive debugging capabilities

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Database Integration** - Set up SQL schema for storing simulation results and parameter sweeps
2. **Advanced Network Dynamics** - Implement adaptive rewiring and support effectiveness mechanisms
3. **R Analysis Pipeline** - Configure R environment for statistical analysis and visualization
4. **Validation Framework** - Implement pattern matching against literature targets using configuration system
5. **Parameter Calibration** - Use configuration system for systematic parameter sweeps and sensitivity analysis

## Current State

- **Core ABM:** Fully functional Python implementation using Mesa framework with all theoretical components
- **Configuration System:** Complete environment-based parameter management with validation and documentation
- **Agent Model:** Complete Person class with all specified state variables and behaviors
- **Network Structure:** Watts-Strogatz social network with configurable parameters via environment variables
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suite with unit tests, integration tests, configuration validation, and CI/CD pipeline
- **Debug Tools:** Threshold evaluation and stress processing debugging utilities for troubleshooting
- **Coverage Reporting:** Automated test coverage tracking with 80% minimum threshold and HTML report generation
- **Dependencies:** Mesa, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, python-dotenv, pytest implemented; R environment configured but not yet integrated
- **Data Storage:** Directory structure ready; SQL integration pending
- **Documentation:** Complete configuration system documentation; protocol development ready to begin

## Key Decisions Made

- **Primary implementation language:** Python with Mesa framework (chosen for ABM capabilities and ease of use)
- **Network framework:** NetworkX for graph operations and network analysis
- **Architecture pattern:** Modular utility-based design for maximum testability and maintainability
- **Testing approach:** Unit tests for all utility functions before integration

## Key Decisions Resolved

- **Framework choice:** Mesa ABM framework selected over custom implementation
- **Network topology:** Watts-Strogatz small-world networks for realistic social connections
- **Code organization:** Utility-first modular design with comprehensive testing
