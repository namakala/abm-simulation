"""
Integration tests for affect and resilience dynamics in realistic network scenarios.

This file demonstrates how the enhanced affect and resilience dynamics work together
in realistic social network interactions and event-based scenarios. The tests show:

1. **Social Influence Scenario**: Multiple agents influencing each other through network connections
2. **Stress Event Scenario**: Agents experiencing challenge vs hindrance events with different affect responses
3. **Recovery Scenario**: Agents recovering from stress through social support and homeostasis
4. **Cumulative Overload Scenario**: Agents experiencing consecutive hindrance events leading to overload effects

Key features demonstrated:
- N_INFLUENCING_NEIGHBORS parameter controlling how many neighbors affect an agent
- N_INFLUENCING_HINDRANCE parameter for cumulative overload effects
- Integration between affect and resilience dynamics
- Event appraisal effects on both affect and resilience
- Homeostasis tendency bringing agents back to baseline

The tests use realistic psychological scenarios grounded in theory and demonstrate
how the model creates realistic agent behavior in social network contexts.
