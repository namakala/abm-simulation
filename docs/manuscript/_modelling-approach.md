The core components from prior ABM literature [@Romanyukha2023; @Murase2021; @Andarlia2021; @Lopez2024; @Benny2022] were integrated into a unified framework for evaluating the homeostasis mechanism of the human psyche. Building on established social network dynamics and mental health contagion mechanisms, our model incorporated comprehensive stress perception via the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), challenge-hindrance appraisal, and resilience dynamics, enabling simulation of homeostatic mechanisms that determine population-level mental health outcomes.

The simulation was operated through structured daily steps: (1) agent initialization with baseline resilience, affect, and resources; (2) stress event generation with controllability and overload attributes; (3) appraisal yielding challenge/hindrance scores; (4) coping decisions influenced by social networks; (5) mutual affect and resilience exchanges; (6) resource allocation across protective factors; and (7) homeostatic adjustments toward equilibrium. Network adaptation occurred when chronic stress triggers rewiring based on homophily and support effectiveness.

Key departures from prior work included PSS-10 integration for validated stress measurement and explicit resource dynamics with softmax allocation. Literature-supported elements include social contagion [@Andarlia2021] and network formation [@Murase2021], while PSS-10 bifactor modeling and resilience mechanisms remain empirically grounded but require further validation against longitudinal data. Model is highly applicable for simulating psychological resilience, though limitations include unvalidated parameter ranges, necessitating sensitivity analysis.
