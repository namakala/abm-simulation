This study simulates stress perception using an ABM approach. Stress perception is operationalized as a generalization of the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), following the guidance provided in its interpretation manual [@cohen1988perceived]. Modeling stress perception is essential for capturing the activation of psychological resilience [@parsons2016cognitive]. Under equivalent stress exposure, agents with higher resilience are less likely to develop psychological disorders, whereas less resilient agents are more vulnerable. The simulation incorporates multiple psychological resources, including social support, family support, and psychological capital, with the latter encompassing personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion [@Hobfoll1989; @klaver2021exposure; @ZagerKocjan2021].

The relevance of ABM lies in its ability to simulate complex social dynamics that traditional methods cannot capture. Psychological resilience operates through homeostatic mechanisms influenced by social interactions, where supportive networks enhance resource conservation and mitigate stress [@Hobfoll2002; @FasihiHarandi2017]. ABM allows for the representation of heterogeneous agents with varying baseline characteristics, enabling the exploration of how agent interactions affect population-level resilience [@Andarlia2021; @Lopez2024]. Our ABM implementation aimed to resolve the question:

> Can agent-based simulations effectively model the homeostatic mechanisms of psychological resilience by incorporating social network dynamics and agent interactions that either support or deteriorate mental health outcomes?

By configuring the base population in an agent-based simulation, we can simulate the homeostatic mechanism of psychological resilience, where agent interactions determine outcomes. Population metrics will remain within a constant range, reflecting a stable homeostatic state.
