Exploratory data analysis was conducted on the exported simulation data at both the agent level and the population level. Agent-level data encompassed individual data for each simulation epoch, capturing the unique trajectories of each agent over time. In contrast, population-level data consisted of aggregated metrics for each simulation epoch, providing a summary view of collective behavior across the entire agent population.

For agent-level data, the first and final epochs were extracted to examine initial and end-state distributions. Histograms were visualized for the core variables: resilience, affect, stress, and PSS-10, enabling assessment of shifts in individual agent characteristics throughout the simulation. For population-level data, stability over time was assessed by computing moving averages to smooth temporal fluctuations and highlight long-term trends. Specifically, 7-step moving averages (7-MA), 14-step moving averages (14-MA), and 28-step moving averages (28-MA) were calculated for key metrics, allowing evaluation of whether population-level indicators remained within stable ranges or exhibited significant deviations.

The rationale for this analytical approach stems from the research question and hypotheses outlined in the study. The primary question investigates whether agent-based simulations can effectively model the homeostatic mechanisms of psychological resilience through social network dynamics and agent interactions. By analyzing agent-level data, we examined how individual resilience, affect, stress, and PSS-10 scores evolved, reflecting the activation of psychological resilience under stress exposure. The visualization of histograms for initial and final epochs allowed for the identification of heterogeneity in agent responses, supporting the hypothesis that agents with higher resilience are less likely to develop psychological disorders.

At the population level, the assessment of stability through moving averages tested the hypothesis that population metrics would remain within a constant range, indicative of a stable homeostatic state. This approach captured the influence of social interactions and resource dynamics on collective mental health outcomes, enabling validation of whether the simulation accurately represented homeostatic mechanisms. Together, these analyses provided empirical evidence for the model's ability to simulate complex social dynamics that traditional methods cannot capture, thereby addressing the core inquiry into the efficacy of agent-based modeling for understanding psychological resilience.
