The simulation results reproduced homeostatic psychological dynamics through agent-based modeling of social network interactions. Population-level metrics maintained stable equilibrium despite individual heterogeneity. This supports the hypothesis that agent interactions determine mental health outcomes within constrained ranges.

The observed homeostatic stability aligns with resilience research. This emphasizes social support systems as protective factors against psychological distress [@Hobfoll1989]. The model successfully reproduced empirically grounded associations between psychological variables. Resilience showed negative correlations with stress and PSS-10 scores. These patterns mirror community resilience studies demonstrating supportive networks enhance resource conservation and stress mitigation [@FasihiHarandi2017].

As demonstrated in @fig-final-population, the agent population exhibits bimodal distribution on affect and stress levels. This pattern appeared as distinct clustering around stable equilibrium points. It captured complex adaptive system behaviors where local heterogeneity supports global stability [@Yan2017]. Previous ABM mental health research demonstrated similar emergent phenomena through social contagion mechanisms [@Andarlia2021]. The current model extends these findings by incorporating comprehensive appraisal processes and resource management systems. The simulation framework provides a robust foundation for evaluating preventive mental health interventions.

The phenomenon emerged from the interaction of multiple mechanisms operating at different scales. The network adaptation equation demonstrated how homophily strength balances similarity preferences with support effectiveness. This maintains network cohesion while enabling adaptive rewiring. Connection similarity quantified how affect and resilience differences influence relationship formation patterns. Network rewiring triggers occurred when chronic stress breaches exceed adaptation thresholds. Persistently distressed agents modify their social environments to improve support access. The support effectiveness equation demonstrated how neighbor resilience and affect combine to determine mutual aid capacity. These mechanisms collectively produce the bimodal affect-stress distribution. As observed in @fig-final-population, agents cluster into stable social groups that maintain collective equilibrium.

The stress processing pipeline transformed life events into psychological responses through challenge-hindrance appraisal mechanisms. The appraisal equation combined with sigmoid transformation produced balanced challenge-hindrance patterns that maintain cognitive processing neutrality. The effective threshold equation demonstrates how challenge and hindrance appraisals modify stress response thresholds dynamically. Coping success probability integrates social influence through neighbor affect averaging. This produces consistent coping rates that sustain population-level resilience. Resource management equations demonstrate affect-modulated recovery. This maintains stable resource levels supporting sustained coping capacity. The daily integration framework normalizes challenge-hindrance values across Poisson-distributed subevents. This ensures consistent temporal dynamics regardless of daily stress exposure variability. Homeostatic adjustments provide natural system restoration toward baseline equilibrium. This creates the stable population metrics observed across all simulation epochs.

The simulation demonstrated that population-level mental health outcomes emerge from complex interactions. These occur between individual characteristics, social network structures, and environmental stressors. The model validated agent-based approaches for evaluating preventive strategies that enhance psychological resilience through social support optimization [@Benny2022]. However, this study exclusive focused on resilience mechanisms without incorporating mental health outcomes. The validation was primarily through pattern matching rather than longitudinal empirical integration. The simulation also makes assumptions of stationary social network structures that ignore demographic transitions over extended periods. Notwithstanding these limitations, future research may find practical uses of the simulation framework. This model can be modified to evaluate the impact of public mental health policies that leverage social interaction mechanisms.
