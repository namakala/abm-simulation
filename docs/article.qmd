# Introduction

Anxiety and depression are among the most prevalent psychological disorders in the general population, generating substantial socioeconomic consequences [@gbd2022global; @arias2022quantifying]. These conditions impose considerable direct and indirect costs, while curative and rehabilitative approaches often demonstrate limited effectiveness [@mekonen2021estimating]. Strengthening psychological resilience offers a preventive pathway to reduce vulnerability to such disorders [@troy2023psychological]. Public health policy should therefore prioritize preventive strategies that foster resilience. However, designing cost-effective preventive policies requires rigorous assessment methods. Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a promising approach to simulate psychological resilience and generate evidence to guide interventions aimed at enhancing resilience at the population level.

# Results

Under homogeneous initial conditions representing a general population, the model converged to a stable equilibrium across all key variables. Mean perceived stress ($\mu_{PSS-10}$ = 19.44 ± 0.10), resilience ($\mu_{res}$ = 0.48 ± 0.01), and affect ($\mu_{affect}$ = −0.045 ± 0.004) remained consistent throughout the simulation. Variance across agents was minimal, indicating that emotional and resilience homeostasis mechanisms function as designed. Coping success stabilized around 0.45, balancing challenge and hindrance appraisals. These findings validate that the model captures stable psychological dynamics in the absence of perturbation, forming a robust baseline for subsequent experiments involving stress shocks or social disturbances.

: Descriptive findings on the model level

The model-level data reveal a system characterized by marked stability and equilibrium across psychological and social dimensions. Aggregate stress, resilience, and affect indicators exhibit limited variability, suggesting that the simulated population reached a steady-state dynamic. The balance between challenge and hindrance appraisals indicates that agents, on average, perceived stressors as neither predominantly threatening nor facilitating, implying a neutral cognitive framing of stress events. Similarly, the near-constant network density and social support rate highlight a static social structure in which interpersonal connectivity remained fixed throughout the simulation. Despite this structural stability, behavioral outcomes such as coping success and social exchanges demonstrate bounded variability, reflecting modest inter-agent heterogeneity in adaptive processes. Overall, the model-level summary suggests that the collective system maintained homeostasis while allowing limited individual differentiation in coping and social behaviors.

: Descriptive findings on the agent level

At the agent level, the data depict dynamic variability embedded within an overall stable population structure. Individual measures of stress, affect, and resilience fluctuate widely across time and agents, capturing the stochastic and adaptive nature of micro-level psychological processes. The broad range in perceived stress and resilience underscores individual differences in vulnerability and coping potential, consistent with naturalistic behavioral diversity. Measures of stress controllability and overload suggest a dynamic tension between agents’ perceived ability to manage stressors and their exposure to them, resulting in a balance between effective adaptation and temporary overload. The occurrence of extended hindrance sequences further illustrates intermittent periods of cumulative stress before recovery. Taken together, the agent-level summary portrays a complex adaptive system in which individuals exhibit continuous fluctuations around a stable population mean, thereby supporting emergent equilibrium at the collective level.

# Discussion

The findings of this study demonstrate that the agent-based model successfully reproduces stable psychological and social dynamics under homogeneous baseline conditions. The convergence of key indicators, including perceived stress, resilience, and affect, indicates that the model reliably captures equilibrium states that align with empirical expectations of population-level homeostasis. The observed stability suggests that the implemented mechanisms governing stress perception, coping, and social exchange are internally consistent and theoretically coherent. This provides a solid foundation for further experimentation involving environmental shocks or targeted interventions, where deviations from equilibrium can reveal the resilience properties of the simulated population.

At the macro level, the model demonstrates that collective patterns of stress and resilience can remain balanced even when individual-level fluctuations are present. The equilibrium between challenge and hindrance appraisals implies that agents, on average, experience stressors as manageable rather than destabilizing. This mirrors empirical findings in resilience research, where moderate stress exposure often promotes adaptive functioning rather than deterioration [@Fletcher2013; @Waldeck2021]. The stability of network characteristics, such as constant density and social exchange rates, indicates that the system’s social structure was sufficient to sustain equilibrium without requiring additional external regulation. Together, these results highlight the model’s capacity to reproduce homeostatic processes commonly observed in resilient populations.

At the micro level, individual trajectories exhibit substantial variability, reflecting the stochastic and adaptive nature of psychological processes within the model. Agents display diverse patterns of stress perception, coping success, and affective regulation, yet the system collectively stabilizes around its mean state. This emergent property is consistent with theories of complex adaptive systems, in which local heterogeneity supports global stability [@Yan2017]. The wide range in resilience and perceived controllability further indicates that the model effectively captures inter-individual differences that are central to resilience theory. Importantly, transient stress overloads and recovery cycles emerge naturally from the interaction of cognitive and social mechanisms, underscoring the ecological validity of the model’s behavioral assumptions.

Overall, this study advances the use of agent-based modeling for investigating psychological resilience and stress adaptation. By reproducing both stability and variability, the model bridges individual-level dynamics and population-level outcomes, offering a valuable tool for testing preventive mental health interventions. Future research should extend this framework by introducing perturbations such as social disruptions, environmental stressors, or policy interventions to examine how resilience unfolds under adversity. Incorporating longitudinal empirical data would further strengthen the model’s external validity and support its application in the design of resilience-enhancing public health strategies.

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of agent-based modeling to capture the dynamic interplay between stress perception, resilience, and social interaction within a simulated population. By operationalizing psychological constructs such as perceived stress, coping, and social support, the model reproduces realistic patterns of equilibrium and individual variability, consistent with the established theory on resilience and adaptation. The results validate the internal coherence of the model and establish a baseline framework for future experiments involving perturbations or policy interventions. As such, this work contributes a methodological foundation for the quantitative evaluation of preventive mental health strategies, enabling systematic exploration of how psychological and social mechanisms jointly shape population resilience.
