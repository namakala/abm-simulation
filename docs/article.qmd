# Introduction

Anxiety and depression are among the most prevalent psychological disorders in the general population, generating substantial socioeconomic consequences [@gbd2022global; @arias2022quantifying]. These conditions impose considerable direct and indirect costs, while curative and rehabilitative approaches often demonstrate limited effectiveness [@mekonen2021estimating]. Strengthening psychological resilience offers a preventive pathway to reduce vulnerability to such disorders [@troy2023psychological]. Public health policy should therefore prioritize preventive strategies that foster resilience. However, designing cost-effective preventive policies requires rigorous assessment methods. Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a promising approach to simulate psychological resilience and generate evidence to guide interventions aimed at enhancing resilience at the population level.

## Previous ABM Publications

The following five articles were selected for their relevance to the development of ABM simulations addressing mental health, social interaction, or their intersection. Each study contributed unique methodological insights that informed the current work. While some articles demonstrated only minimal overlap with our research, they were included because they resolved specific modeling challenges pertinent to our framework. Collectively, these studies provided a foundation for constructing comprehensive and realistic ABM simulations in the context of mental health and social dynamics.

@Romanyukha2023 implemented an ABM to evaluate the mental health consequences of policy measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The model integrated epidemic dynamics with the development of mental disorders in a large urban population. Using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALY) as an outcome measure, the study considered major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, COVID-19 cases (lethal and non-lethal), and immunization. The results showed that mental disorders accounted for a substantial share of pandemic-related health losses, and under strong lockdown conditions, the lowest QALY loss occurred when approximately 70% of the population was isolated. These findings demonstrate that ABM can quantify the impact of policy interventions on mental health outcomes, supporting its use for evaluating preventive strategies that enhance psychological resilience.

@Murase2021 introduced a generalized weighted social network (GWSN) model to describe the formation of social ties and networks. The GWSN model integrates mechanisms previously examined in isolation, including triadic closure (the tendency for friends of friends to become friends), homophilic interactions, and link termination processes. Due to the model's complexity and numerous input parameters, the authors combined extensive simulations with deep neural networks for regression and global sensitivity analysis, enabling prediction of network properties and identification of key determinants of network dynamics. By providing a robust framework for modeling realistic social interactions, this approach is directly relevant for simulating how social connectivity influences resilience and the spread of mental disorders in ABM.

@Andarlia2021 examined the contagion effect of psychological disorders using ABM to simulate the spread of depression in a population. The model accounted for the influence of close social relationships, which could trigger mild, moderate, or severe depressive episodes, and modeled recovery through therapy with transition dynamics and recovery rates differentiated by gender. Simulation results indicated that higher contact rates with depressed individuals increased episode severity, whereas greater therapy uptake reduced depression prevalence. This study highlights how ABM can capture both the propagation and mitigation of mental disorders through social mechanisms, a key component for modeling interventions aimed at strengthening psychological resilience.

@Lopez2024 introduced a methodology embedding an ABM within adaptive temporal networks to simulate daily interactions and examine the interplay between infectious disease spread and individual behavior. The model integrates individual behavior, social dynamics, and epidemiological factors, validated using real-world influenza outbreak data, and can simulate complex social phenomena such as social awareness. By incorporating self-organized system logic, agents respond dynamically to external stimuli, perceptions, and health states. Combined with social network models and mental health contagion dynamics, this approach demonstrates that ABM can simulate emergent phenomena arising from the interaction of social behavior and health, providing a powerful tool for testing policies that influence population resilience.

@Benny2022 employed ABM to evaluate the impact of government policies on mental health, focusing on depression in expectant mothers. The model incorporated parameters from the "All Our Families" cohort dataset and literature, including household income, age, education, and environmental factors. The study hypothesized that income-supportive programs would reduce maternal depression, and simulations confirmed that progressive income policies significantly lowered prevalence. Additionally, modeling mothers' social networks showed that expanding social connections further reduced depression risk. These findings illustrate that ABM can assess the effectiveness of policy interventions on mental health outcomes, underscoring its applicability for designing strategies to enhance resilience and reduce the prevalence of psychological disorders.

## Current Research

This study aims to simulate stress perception using an ABM approach. Stress perception is operationalized as a generalization of the Perceived Stress Scale-10, following the guidance provided in its interpretation manual [@cohen1988perceived]. Modeling stress perception is essential for capturing the activation of psychological resilience [@parsons2016cognitive]. Under equivalent stress exposure, agents with higher resilience are less likely to develop psychological disorders, whereas less resilient agents are more vulnerable. The simulation incorporates multiple psychological resources, including social support, family support, and psychological capital, with the latter encompassing personality traits such as openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion [@Hobfoll1989; @klaver2021exposure; @ZagerKocjan2021].

# Methods

## Affect

Affect represents an individual's current emotional state, ranging from very negative to very positive. The model examines how various factors influence these emotional states, including social connections, stress events, and natural tendencies to return to an individual's baseline emotional level.

### Social Influence on Affect

The affect of agent $i$ at time $t+1$ is influenced by the affect of neighboring agents $j \in N_i$:

$$\Delta a_{i,t+1}^{social} = \alpha \sum_{j \in N_i} (a_{j,t} - a_{i,t})$$

where $\alpha$ represents the peer influence rate and $N_i$ is the set of neighboring agents.

### Stress Event Impact

Stress events modify affect based on challenge-hindrance appraisal and coping outcomes:

$$\Delta a_{i,t+1}^{stress} = \beta \cdot (c_i \cdot s_i - h_i \cdot f_i)$$

where $\beta$ is the event appraisal rate, $c_i$ and $h_i$ represent challenge and hindrance components, $s_i$ is coping success (1 for success, 0 for failure), and $f_i$ is coping failure (1 for failure, 0 for success).

### Homeostatic Regulation

Affect naturally returns to baseline through homeostatic processes:

$$a_{i,t+1} = a_{i,t} + \gamma (a_{i,0} - a_{i,t}) + \Delta a_{i,t+1}^{social} + \Delta a_{i,t+1}^{stress}$$

where $\gamma$ is the homeostatic rate and $a_{i,0}$ is the baseline affect level.

### Resilience-Affect Integration

Positive affect enhances resource regeneration, while high resilience provides emotional buffering:

$$r_{i,t+1} = r_{i,t} + \delta \cdot \max(0, a_{i,t}) \cdot R_{max} - \epsilon \cdot \max(0, -a_{i,t})$$

where $r_i$ represents resources, $\delta$ is the positive affect regeneration bonus, $\epsilon$ is the negative affect regeneration penalty, and $R_{max}$ is maximum resource capacity.

## Stress Perception

Stress perception follows a comprehensive pipeline that transforms life events into psychological stress responses using the challenge-hindrance framework.

### Challenge-Hindrance Appraisal

Each stress event $e_i$ is characterized by controllability $c_i \in [0,1]$ and overload $o_i \in [0,1]$:

$$z_i = \omega_c c_i - \omega_o o_i + b$$

$$challenge_i = \sigma(\gamma z_i) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\gamma z_i}}$$

$$hindrance_i = 1 - challenge_i$$

where $\omega_c$ and $\omega_o$ are weight parameters, $b$ is a bias term, and $\gamma$ controls sigmoid steepness.

### PSS-10 Bifactor Model

The PSS-10 integrates controllability and overload dimensions using a bifactor model:

$$PSS_{10_{total}} = \sum_{k=1}^{10} item_k$$

$$item_k = \mu_k + \lambda_k^c \cdot C + \lambda_k^o \cdot O + \epsilon_k$$

where $C \sim N(0,1)$ and $O \sim N(0,1)$ are latent factors with correlation $\rho$, $\lambda_k^c$ and $\lambda_k^o$ are factor loadings, $\mu_k$ are item means, and $\epsilon_k$ are residuals.

### Stress Threshold Evaluation

An agent becomes stressed when appraised stress load exceeds their dynamic threshold:

$$L_i = s_i \cdot (1 + \delta \cdot (hindrance_i - challenge_i))$$

$$T_{i,effective} = T_{base} + \lambda_C \cdot challenge_i - \lambda_H \cdot hindrance_i$$

$$stressed_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } L_i > T_{i,effective} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

where $s_i$ is event magnitude, $\delta$ controls challenge-hindrance polarity, $\lambda_C$ and $\lambda_H$ are threshold scaling parameters, and $T_{base}$ is the baseline threshold.

## Resilience

Resilience represents an individual's capacity to adapt and recover from stress events, with state variables including current resilience level, baseline resilience, consecutive hindrances, and stress breach count.

### Resilience Changes from Coping Outcomes

Resilience updates based on challenge-hindrance appraisal and coping success:

$$\Delta r_i = \begin{cases}
\rho_{success} \cdot challenge_i & \text{if coping successful} \\
\rho_{minor} \cdot hindrance_i & \text{if coping successful} \\
-\rho_{failure} \cdot hindrance_i & \text{if coping failed} \\
-\rho_{minor} \cdot challenge_i & \text{if coping failed}
\end{cases}$$

where $\rho_{success}$, $\rho_{minor}$, $\rho_{failure}$ are rate parameters for different outcomes.

### Social Support Boost

Social support provides resilience enhancement:

$$r_{i,t+1} = r_{i,t} + \sigma_{support} \cdot \sum_{j \in supporters} q_j$$

where $\sigma_{support}$ is the social support rate and $q_j$ is the quality of support from agent $j$.

### Overload Effects

Cumulative hindrance events create overload when exceeding threshold:

$$overload_i = \begin{cases} 1 & \text{if } h_i^{consecutive} > \theta_{overload} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

$$\Delta r_{i,overload} = -\nu \cdot overload_i$$

where $\theta_{overload}$ is the overload threshold and $\nu$ is the overload penalty rate.

### Homeostatic Adjustment

Resilience returns to baseline over time:

$$r_{i,t+1} = r_{i,t} + \eta (r_{i,0} - r_{i,t}) + \Delta r_i + \Delta r_{i,overload}$$

where $\eta$ is the homeostatic rate and $r_{i,0}$ is baseline resilience.

### Coping Success Determination

Coping probability integrates challenge-hindrance effects and social influence:

$$p_{coping_i} = p_{base} + \phi_C \cdot challenge_i - \phi_H \cdot hindrance_i + \psi \cdot \bar{a}_{N_i}$$

where $p_{base}$ is base coping probability, $\phi_C$ and $\phi_H$ are challenge and hindrance modifiers, $\psi$ is social influence strength, and $\bar{a}_{N_i}$ is average neighbor affect.

## Agent Interaction

Agent interactions form the core social dynamics through a grid-based social network reflecting real-world spatial relationships.

### Network Structure

Agents are positioned on a 2D grid with connections to Moore neighbors:

$$N_i = \{j \mid \max(|x_i - x_j|, |y_i - y_j|) \leq 1, j \neq i\}$$

where $(x_i, y_i)$ are grid coordinates of agent $i$.

### Social Influence Dynamics

Social interactions create bidirectional affect changes with asymmetric effects:

$$\Delta a_{i,t+1} = \mu \sum_{j \in N_i} (a_{j,t} - a_{i,t})$$

$$\Delta a_{j,t+1} = \mu \sum_{i \in N_j} (a_{i,t} - a_{j,t})$$

where $\mu$ is the interaction influence rate.

### Network Adaptation

Stress triggers network rewiring based on homophily and support effectiveness:

$$p_{rewire_i} = \begin{cases}
\pi & \text{if } stress_i^{breaches} > \theta_{adapt} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

### Homophily-Based Connection

Connection probability considers stress and affect similarity:

$$p_{connect_{ij}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\kappa (similarity_{ij} - 0.5)}}$$

$$similarity_{ij} = 1 - \frac{|stress_i - stress_j| + |a_i - a_j|}{2}$$

where $\kappa$ controls homophily strength.

### Social Support Dynamics

Support provision depends on neighbor affect and resilience:

$$support_{ij} = \begin{cases}
q_j \cdot r_j & \text{if } a_j > \theta_{support} \\ 0 & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}$$

where $q_j$ is support quality and $\theta_{support}$ is the support threshold.

## Psychological Resource Management

Resource management implements conservation of resources theory, where individuals have limited psychological and physical resources to allocate across protective strategies.

### Resource Regeneration

Resources regenerate toward maximum capacity with affect modulation:

$$R_{i,t+1} = R_{i,t} + \rho (R_{max} - R_{i,t}) + \delta \cdot \max(0, a_{i,t}) \cdot R_{max}$$

where $\rho$ is the base regeneration rate, $R_{max}$ is maximum resource capacity, and $\delta$ is the positive affect bonus.

### Resource Consumption

Successful coping consumes resources proportional to event hindrance:

$$R_{i,t+1} = R_{i,t} - \kappa \cdot hindrance_i \cdot s_i$$

where $\kappa$ is the resource cost parameter and $s_i$ indicates coping success.

### Softmax Resource Allocation

Resources are allocated across protective factors using softmax decision-making:

$$allocation_{i,k} = \frac{e^{u_{i,k}/\tau}}{\sum_{m=1}^4 e^{u_{i,m}/\tau}} \cdot R_{i,t}$$

$$u_{i,k} = \alpha_k \cdot (1 - p_{i,k}) + \beta \cdot (1 - resilience_i)$$

where $\tau$ is the softmax temperature, $u_{i,k}$ is the utility of protective factor $k$, $\alpha_k$ is the efficacy of factor $k$, $p_{i,k}$ is the current protection level, and $\beta$ controls need-based allocation.

### Protective Factor Dynamics

Protective factors improve based on resource investment:

$$\Delta p_{i,k} = \gamma_k \cdot allocation_{i,k} \cdot (1 - p_{i,k})$$

where $\gamma_k$ is the improvement rate for protective factor $k$.

**Gain/Loss Spirals:**
The model captures resource spirals through coupled dynamics:

**Gain Spiral:** $R \uparrow \rightarrow allocation \uparrow \rightarrow p \uparrow \rightarrow coping \uparrow \rightarrow a \uparrow \rightarrow regeneration \uparrow$

**Loss Spiral:** $R \downarrow \rightarrow allocation \downarrow \rightarrow p \downarrow \rightarrow coping \downarrow \rightarrow a \downarrow \rightarrow regeneration \downarrow$

## Model Integration

The agent-based model integrates six core mechanism groups that work together to simulate realistic mental health dynamics through a comprehensive state transition framework.

### Agent State Vector

Each agent $i$ maintains a complete state vector updated daily:

$$\mathbf{s}_{i,t+1} = f(\mathbf{s}_{i,t}, \mathbf{e}_{i,t}, \mathbf{n}_{i,t}, \mathbf{\theta})$$

where $\mathbf{s}_i = [a_i, r_i, stress_i, \mathbf{p}_i, R_i, pss10_i]$ represents affect, resilience, stress level, protective factors, resources, and PSS-10 scores; $\mathbf{e}_i$ are external events; $\mathbf{n}_i$ are network influences; and $\mathbf{\theta}$ are model parameters.

### Daily Step Integration

Each simulation day follows a structured sequence:

1. **Initialization:** $\mathbf{s}_{i,t}^{init} = initialize(\mathbf{s}_{i,t-1})$
2. **Event Processing:** $\mathbf{e}_{i,t} \sim P(\mathbf{e}|\mathbf{s}_{i,t}^{init}, \mathbf{\theta})$
3. **Social Interaction:** $\Delta \mathbf{s}_{i,t}^{social} = g(\mathbf{s}_{N_i,t}, \mathbf{\theta}_{social})$
4. **Stress Appraisal:** $stress_{i,t} = appraise(\mathbf{e}_{i,t}, \mathbf{\theta}_{stress})$
5. **Coping Determination:** $coping_i = h(stress_{i,t}, r_{i,t}, \mathbf{s}_{N_i,t})$
6. **State Updates:** $\mathbf{s}_{i,t+1} = update(\mathbf{s}_{i,t}, \Delta \mathbf{s}_{i,t}^{social}, stress_{i,t}, coping_i)$
7. **Homeostasis:** $\mathbf{s}_{i,t+1} = homeostasis(\mathbf{s}_{i,t+1}, \mathbf{s}_{i,0})$

### Feedback Loops

**Positive Reinforcement Loop:**
$$r_{t+1} = r_t + \phi_{success} \cdot challenge \cdot coping_{success}$$
$$a_{t+1} = a_t + \beta \cdot coping_{success} \cdot challenge$$
$$R_{t+1} = R_t + \delta \cdot \max(0, a_{t+1})$$

**Negative Degradation Loop:**
$$r_{t+1} = r_t - \phi_{failure} \cdot hindrance \cdot coping_{failure}$$
$$a_{t+1} = a_t - \beta \cdot coping_{failure} \cdot hindrance$$
$$R_{t+1} = R_t - \epsilon \cdot \max(0, -a_{t+1})$$

**Social Amplification Loop:**
$$\Delta a_i = \mu \sum_{j \in N_i} (a_j - a_i)$$
$$p_{connect_{ij}} = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\kappa |a_i - a_j|}}$$

**Homeostatic Equilibria:**
The system tends toward equilibrium points where all mechanisms balance:

$$\frac{d\mathbf{s}}{dt} = 0 \implies \mathbf{s}^* = equilibrium(\mathbf{\theta})$$

where $\mathbf{s}^*$ represents stable mental health states depending on parameter configurations and social network structure.
