# Introduction

Anxiety and depression are among the most prevalent psychological disorders in the general population, generating substantial socioeconomic consequences [@gbd2022global; @arias2022quantifying]. These conditions impose considerable direct and indirect costs, while curative and rehabilitative approaches often demonstrate limited effectiveness [@mekonen2021estimating]. Strengthening psychological resilience offers a preventive pathway to reduce vulnerability to such disorders [@troy2023psychological]. Public health policy should therefore prioritize preventive strategies that foster resilience. However, designing cost-effective preventive policies requires rigorous assessment methods. Agent-based modeling (ABM) provides a promising approach to simulate psychological resilience and generate evidence to guide interventions aimed at enhancing resilience at the population level.

# Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of agent-based modeling to capture the dynamic interplay between stress perception, resilience, and social interaction within a simulated population. By operationalizing psychological constructs such as perceived stress, coping, and social support, the model reproduces realistic patterns of equilibrium and individual variability, consistent with the established theory on resilience and adaptation. The results validate the internal coherence of the model and establish a baseline framework for future experiments involving perturbations or policy interventions. As such, this work contributes a methodological foundation for the quantitative evaluation of preventive mental health strategies, enabling systematic exploration of how psychological and social mechanisms jointly shape population resilience.
